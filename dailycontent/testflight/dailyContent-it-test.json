While this is certainly bad, it’s not the doom scenario about which you might have heard: that the Oceans will be empty by 2048. This is not true (as the research is more nuanced). There are also some fish populations which actually have a sustainable level. But the FAO’s figure of two-thirds at a sustainable level might be too positive, according to researchers in the field.\n\nBut let’s not be stopped by the difficulties in interpreting data about fish populations: let’s take action! It is possible to recover the overfished stocks and bring back nature’s balance.\n\nOverall we can decide to eat sustainable amounts of seafood and if we do eat wild-caught seafood, to buy MSC-certified fish. It's the best guarantee (definitely not perfect) that you don't eat fish that's being overfished.\n\nAnd what about farmed fish? We’ll look at it next time we visit the Ocean.",

While honey bees are really good at collecting pollen for honey, they don’t stop at other flowers to pollinate them. And if there are two bee hives in one area, there is no more food for other pollinators.\n\nSo eating honey is not helping (pollinating) insects. Instead, to increase biodiversity you can eat more organic products and keep native plants in your garden.\n",
